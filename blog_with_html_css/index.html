            In my short programming career of 10 years, I have primarily used two programming languages: C languages and Python. And, both of them were created before I was born. Both were also created before.

            I think of a great idea, something useful that makes me smile and gets excited. I search on the web and get discouraged to find that pretty good tools already exists in the market. Here I am going to talk about why it is okay to keep building even though there are solutions and how to differentiate.

            In 2016, Dropbox announced that they will be transitioning off the AWS cloud to move to their own datacenter to reduce cost. It made sense for them. Their users stored the files on server for years. Their S3 bill was huge. S3 charges 23 USD to store a terabyte of data on their server. in 50 USD, you can buy a 1 TB SSD and own it forever. So, basically you recover your initial cost in 2 months. Cost of storage is always going down thanks to advancement in semiconductor technologies. Later many companies(reddit, snapchat, twitter, Uber) followed the suit and announced their plans to exit the cloud and host their services in their own datacenters. AWS on average enjoys a good margin of 40 % on their services after deducting investment costs, operating costs as well as R&D costs.

            Enterprises generally deal with large amount of documents generated from variety of sources on which they have no control. And they end up with large amount of data which they need to process for business continuity or compliance reasons.

            Last decade has been a time where “big data“ tools came out every day. benchmarks were released boasting of throughputs and low latency numbers. Little attention was paid to operating costs to run these systems and expertise required to operate these systems. Running these systems was tricky with no tools to manage these systems effectively. Our spark cluster will go down with no warning. Every morning we will come to office to find that spark cluster was dead and no jobs were run last night. SaaS and hyperscaler came to rescue. Don’t worry about operating costs and maintenance costs, but don’t you dare to leave us. :) Often these services come with vendor lock-in.

            In 2009, Alan Mamedi built a caller ID app to identify the callers when you get a call from an unknown number. This was initially a Symbian app running on Nokia phones. Around the same time first version of the android was launched. As android user base started to grow, they developed an android app as well. Their brand name became synonymous with caller ID.

            Since the release of LLaMA to the public, more capable LLMs from companies like Meta, Mixtral, and others have become available, often matching the performance of OpenAI's models. Thanks to market competition, model weights are generally accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
